# Upstream Divergence Tracking

This file tracks modifications to files originating from [apache/incubator-devlake](https://github.com/apache/incubator-devlake)
that must be maintained during upstream syncs.

Owned plugins (`aireview`, `codecov`, `testregistry`, `agentready`, `langfuse`) are additions,
not modifications, and are not tracked here.

## gitextractor: ForceFullClone / FORCE_FULL_GIT_HISTORY

**Files:**
- `backend/plugins/gitextractor/impl/impl.go`
- `backend/plugins/gitextractor/parser/clone_gitcli.go`
- `backend/plugins/gitextractor/parser/taskdata.go`
- `env.example`

**Reason:** Upstream gitextractor incremental syncs miss commits via `--shallow-since`.
Adds a separate `ForceFullClone` strategy that bypasses shallow cloning entirely,
controlled by the `FORCE_FULL_GIT_HISTORY` environment variable. Also fixes a temp
directory leak in `doubleClone()`.

**Upstream status:** Pending
**Upstream PR:** none yet
**Owner:** @kpiwko

**Rebase notes:** Touches clone strategy selection in `clone_gitcli.go`.
Watch for upstream changes to `CloneRepo()`, `shallowClone()`, or `doubleClone()`.
